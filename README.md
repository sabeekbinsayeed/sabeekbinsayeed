Assalamu alaikum, I'm Sabeek Bin Sayeed, a passionate programmer, web developer and teacher with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I have a proven track record of sharing my programming knowledge with others, through various organizations and my popular Python course on Amar iSchool. My experience as a project manager and content writer at Miritus Limited has honed my leadership and technical skills. I also run a Facebook group of 4k members, where I share tech articles, blogs, and videos, as well as a YouTube channel to further spread my knowledge.

Teaching is my passion, and I am committed to having a positive impact on society through my programming skills. My goal is to become a skilled programmer who can tackle complex problems, write clean and efficient code, and effectively use AI in day-to-day life. I am confident in my abilities and strive to contribute to society through my programming expertise.
